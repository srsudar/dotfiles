Similar to the vim file, this should be the home of all emacs files. To get it
work you should then make a symbolic link as ~/.emacs.d, which is where emacs
looks for its file. I.e. 

ln -s dotfiles/emacs.d ~/.emacs.d

Note that there is a file

dotfiles/emacs.d/emacs_backups/.gitignore

The point of this special ignore file is that emacs versions everything in that
backup folder, and we don't want to be versioning those across systems. They
should stay local, and if you need actual version control on those files you
should be doing it yourself, not using emacs. And there you have it.
