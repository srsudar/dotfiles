Installation:

	

Create symlinks:
	Everything is going to live in .dotfiles/.vim/. 
	Create symlinks so that things look in the correct place
	in the home directory.

	ln -s ~/.dotfiles/.vim ~/.vim # The vim folder itself.
	ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc   # The vimrc.


Initialize the submodules:
	
	git submodule init
	git submodule update
